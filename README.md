**Project Name:** FACTORS AFFECTING CUSTOMER DECISION - SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS USING FLIPKART PRODUCT REVIEW DATA

**Institution:** Dublin Business School, Ireland

Welcome to the repository for our research project, "Factors Affecting Customer Decision - Sentiment Analysis Using Flipkart Product Review Data." This project was conducted as part of the final semester research presentation at Dublin Business School, Ireland.

## Abstract

This project addresses the need for a more accurate and reliable approach to determine product ratings based on customer sentiment in Flipkart product reviews. The primary objective is to predict product ratings based on customer reviews to enhance the accuracy of Flipkart's existing rating system.

### Project Highlights

- **Data Collection:** We employed web scraping techniques to gather a comprehensive dataset of Flipkart product reviews. The data collection code is available in the `data_collection` folder.

- **Datasets:** The `datasets` folder contains seven different datasets, each representing product reviews extracted from Flipkart.

- **Analysis and Evaluation:** Our primary analysis, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, rating prediction, and evaluation are conducted in the `analysis_and_evaluation` folder. This code file encompasses the entire analysis, including data preprocessing and performance evaluation.

- **Project Report:** For detailed insights into the analysis and evaluation, you can access our comprehensive project report in the `Project_Report` folder. The report contains in-depth explanations of the methodology and results.

- **Documentation:** Additional project documentation, resources, and presentations can be found in the 'Documentation' section.
